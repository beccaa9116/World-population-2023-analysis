World Population 2023 â€“ Summary of Analysis

I did this analysis as an entry level data science student who just loves to play with data. Therefore, my methods or conclusions might be wrong, but it was still fun to do and I learnt a bunch of new stuff so it still counts!

The dataset used for the analysis contains 204 countries including their population size in 2023 and 2022, area and land area of these countries and their density, growth rate and world percentage.

In my analysis I was focusing mainly on current population and growth rate.

Findings based on size of population:

-	The most populated country in the dataset is China, followed by India and United States
-	There are 15 countries with population above 100 million 
-	The least populated country is Tuvalu, followed by Nauru and Palau
-	There are 12 countries with population less than 100 thousand 

Findings based on growth rate:

-	Countries with the biggest growth rate are Moldava and Syria with growth rate of 4.98, followed by Niger
-	The fastest declining country is Ukraine with growth rate of -7.45, followed by Lebanon and Bulgaria
-	There are overall 32 countries with a negative growth rate
-	No county is stagnating (no growth rate is equal to 0)
-	The overall average growth rate is 1.06 

Findings based on relation between population size and growth rate:

-	Two out of the top 10 most populated countries are currently declining
-	Nigeria is the fastest growing country out of the top 10 most populated countries
-	Three out of 10 least populated countries are declining, the fastest declining one out of them is Monaco
-	The fastest growing out of the 10 least populated countries are Marshall Islands reaching a growth rate of 1.03
